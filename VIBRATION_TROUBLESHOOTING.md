# Mobile Vibration Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
The Swoop Spotter app attempts to vibrate your device when you enter a swoop zone for enhanced alertness.

---

## ⚠️ Important: iOS Limitation

**iOS (iPhone/iPad) does NOT support the Vibration API in web browsers.**

Apple has intentionally disabled `navigator.vibrate()` on iOS Safari and all iOS browsers due to privacy and battery concerns.

### iOS Users:
- ❌ Web vibration will **NOT** work on iPhone/iPad
- ✅ You will still get:
  - Audio alerts (beep sounds)
  - Visual alerts (centered alert box)
  - Toast notifications

### Workarounds for iOS:
- Use audio alerts (ensure volume is on)
- Enable sound/notifications
- Consider building a native iOS app (future enhancement)

---

## ✅ Android Support

Android devices **DO** support the Vibration API in most modern browsers.

### Supported Browsers:
- ✅ Chrome (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Edge
- ✅ Opera
- ❌ Some older browsers may not support

### Requirements:
1. **HTTPS connection** (required for vibration API)
   - ✅ GitHub Pages uses HTTPS automatically
   
2. **User interaction** (vibration can't trigger without user action first)
   - ✅ We trigger it after user starts tracking or enters zone
   
3. **Browser permissions** (no explicit permission needed, but can be blocked)
   - Check: Settings → Site Settings → Notifications/Vibration

## 🧪 Testing Vibration

### Test Button Added
A "Test Vibration 📳" button has been added below the map.

**Click it to:**
1. Test if vibration works on your device
2. See console logs about vibration support
3. Get feedback about your device capabilities

### What to Look For:

#### Android (Should Work):
```
Console: 📳 Testing vibration...
Console: Vibration API called, result: true
Toast: "Vibration triggered! Did you feel it?"
Device: *vibrates*
```

#### iOS (Won't Work):
```
Console: 📳 Testing vibration...
Console: Vibration API not available
Toast: "⚠️ iOS does not support web vibration API"
Device: *no vibration*
```

---

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Device Type
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log(navigator.userAgent);
```

Look for:
- `iPhone` / `iPad` → iOS (vibration won't work)
- `Android` → Should work

### 2. Check Vibration API Support
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log('vibrate' in navigator);
```

- `true` → API available (but may not work on iOS)
- `false` → API not supported

### 3. Test Manually
```javascript
// In browser console:
navigator.vibrate(500);
```

Should vibrate for 500ms if supported.

### 4. Check Console Logs

When entering a swoop zone, look for:
```
🔔 Alert notification triggered
✅ Audio alert played
📳 Vibration triggered: true
```

Or error messages:
```
❌ Vibration API not supported on this device
ℹ️ iOS detected - vibration not available via web
```

## 🛠️ Vibration Patterns

### Alert Pattern (Entering Swoop Zone):
```
[300, 100, 300, 100, 300]
```
- Vibrate 300ms
- Pause 100ms
- Vibrate 300ms
- Pause 100ms
- Vibrate 300ms

**Total:** ~900ms of noticeable vibration

### Happy Pattern (Exiting All Zones):
```
[100]
```
- Single short vibration (100ms)

## 🔧 Common Issues

### "I'm on Android but vibration doesn't work"

**Check:**
1. **Browser:** Use Chrome for best compatibility
2. **HTTPS:** Ensure you're on `https://` not `http://`
3. **Vibration enabled:** Settings → Sound & vibration → Vibration on
4. **Silent mode:** Vibration might be disabled in silent mode
5. **Battery saver:** Some battery saver modes disable vibration
6. **Browser permissions:** Chrome → Settings → Site Settings

### "Vibration works in test but not in alerts"

**Possible causes:**
1. **Alert already triggered:** Multiple vibrations too close together
2. **Browser throttling:** Some browsers limit vibration frequency
3. **Battery optimization:** System may be suppressing vibrations

**Try:**
- Exit and re-enter swoop zone
- Check console for error messages
- Test with fresh page load

### "Vibration worked before, now doesn't"

**Check:**
1. **Browser update:** Recent updates may have changed behavior
2. **OS update:** System settings may have changed
3. **Battery saver:** May have auto-enabled
4. **Site permissions:** May have been reset
